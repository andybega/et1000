  I have been trying to, on and off, learn Estonian for almost 6 years now 
  (2021). One of the frustrating things has been that I wanted to simply know
  what the most common words are. There is a language learning app that is based
  on that idea, but I just want <i>the list</i> so that I can make physical 
  flash cards.
</p>
<p>
  Well, here it is. One very important caveat: I'm not a linguist. I took 10,000
  documents from a collection of Estonian web content&mdash;the data itself has been
  created by legit people studying language&mdash;to make this. Maybe that web content
  is not the most representative of language in other contexts, but here 
  we go anyways.
